# Montreal Bike Share System
A bike share system using real world data.

### Introduction
In this project, we construct a simulation of a bike-share system using real-world data from Bixi in Montreal. We read in and process data downloaded directly from the Bixi website, and use this data to run a simulation that first produces a visualization of the bikes moving from station to station across Montreal, and then reports some statistics once the simulation has ended.

### Learning Goals
+ implement a class in Python from a provided interface, including
  + defining instance attributes
  + using representation invariants to record important facts about implementation decisions, and
  + defining initializers and other methods

+ use composition and inheritance
+ user Abstract Data Type (ADT) to solve problems
